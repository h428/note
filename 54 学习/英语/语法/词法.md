# 单词类


## almost 用法

- 例句：Pollution is a big problem in almost all the big cities of the world.
- almost 为副词，含义为几乎，用于修饰形容词和副词，且这些被修饰的形容词/副词必须是具有完全性的概念的词类，例如 all, every, any, no 等
- 但 almost many, almost most 是错误用法，因为 many, most 美育完全性概念
- Almost all sailors are good swimmers.
- Almost every shool has a basketball court.
- 注意和 always 连用时，almost 必须放置在 always 之前：My father is almost always in a good mood. 


## answer, key, road, solution 等

- 例句：They are sure that they have found the answer to the problem.
- 固定词法，这类词在针对后面的名词时，通常有隐含的“开启”含义在里面，后面要用 to 连接名词而不是 of
- the key/road/answer/solution to ....
- the key to the room
- the road of victory
- the answer/solution to the problem
- 造句：Hard work is the key to success.


## 连词 though

- 例句：Remember, though, you can't always rely on luck.
- 上述 though 为副词，置于句中，作为插入语，表示“但是”，等价于 however，但二者有所不同：
    - though 可以两端插入逗号置于句中作为插入语，也可以插入前置逗号置于句尾
    - 而 however 可以置于句首，后加逗号；也可以两端插入逗号，作为插入语插入句中，但很少置于句尾使用
    - Bruce is an American. He, though/however, acts very Chinese.
    - Bruce is an American. Hoever, he acts very Chinese.
    - Bruce is an American. He acts very Chinese, though.
- though 也可以置于句首使用，在句首使用时变为副词连词，一般用于引导状语从句，表示“虽然”的意思，等价于连词 although
- Though/Although he is smart, he's not well liked by his classmates.

## go 用法

### go doing

- 例句：Go bungee jumping.
- 表示从事某种短暂的活动，常用“go + 现在分词”来表示
- 例如：go shopping, go picnicking, go hunting, go dancing, 

### go + 距离名词

- 例句：Go one block and take a left.
- go 为不及物动词，后面可跟表距离的名词做副词用，因此理论上 go 之后有一个介词 for，但实际使用时，for 一律省略，类似用法的词还有 walk, run 等
- Walk ten steps forward and look right.

## have 用法

### have sb. done

- 例句：A magazine suggested that a man (should) have a special warning writtern on their foreheads: "I can make you fat!"
- 此处的 have 为使役动词，译成“把”，用法为“have + 宾语 + 过去分词”（把……被……），故此处的 written 是过去分词

- 例句：Being the home of Mozart, this city is the birthplace of classical music and the waltz.

## 感官动词 + V/Ving/Vpp

- 例句：It makes me nervous just to watch someone do it.
- 在英语中，表看、听、感觉三类及物动词称作感官动词，感官动词接了宾语后，还可以额外再接一个动词做宾补：
    - 动词原形做宾补，表示已发生的事实
    - 现在分词作宾补，表示正在发生或进行的状态
    - 过去分词作宾补，表被动概念
- 常见的感官动词有：see, watch, look at; hear, listen to; feel

## so ... that ...

- 例句：This method is so successful that other countries are thinking of doing the same.
- so adj./adv. that + 从句：意为“如此...以至于...”：
    - 在该结构中，so 是副词，后面必须跟副词或者形容词；
    - that 则为副词连接词，其所引导的状语从句修饰前面的 so
- 类似的用法有 such ... that ...，但 such 是形容词，故后面只能跟名词： such + 单/复数名词 + that 从句，含义同样为“如此 ... 以至于 ...”
- It's so hot in summer that we can't do without an air conditioner.
- The teacher spoke so fast that I couldn't understand what he was saying.

## in that

- 例句：Smoking is bad in that it is harmful to one's health.
- in that 为副词性质连接词而不是 in + that 引导的名词性从句，可译为“因为” = because，但 in that 通常置于主句之后，不置于句首；
- 而 because 引导的状语从句则可置于主句之前，两句子用逗号相隔，也可以和 in that 一样将从句置于主句之后中间不添加逗号
- Jogging is good for you in that it helps you keep fit.
- Bacause he is so shy, he seldom goes out with girls. = He seldom goes out with girls because/(in that) he is so shy.


## can't help

- can't help + 动名词，意为忍不住 = can't resist + 动名词 = can't help but + 动词原形
    My sister can't help biting her fingernails when she gets nervous.
    My sister can't resist biting  her fingernails when she gets nervous.
    My sister can't help but bit her fingernails when she gets nervous.
- 属于非谓语做宾语的固定用法，即 cant'help 只能使用动名词做宾语，而 can't help but 只能使用省略 to 的不定式做宾语


## Home come + 主语 + 动词

- 例句：How come you flunked?I thought you did everything the fortuneteller told you to do.
- Home come + 主语 + 动词，为何....？
- = Why is it + that 从句 ？ = Why + 倒装句？

- = A magzine suggested (that) men (should) have a special warning written on their foreheads: "I can make you fat!"
- suggest + (that) 从句  建议……；暗示/示意……
- suggest 做“建议”时，为意志动词，其后的 that 从句需使用助动词 should，但 should 往往省略，而直接接动词原形。常见的意志动词如下：
    - 建议：suggest, recommend, advise, urge, propose, move
    - 要求：ask, desire, demand, require, request
    - 命令：order, command
    - 规定：rule, regulate, stipulate, prescribe

# 半句法类

## 并列句简化

- 例句：Being the home of Mozart, this city is the birthplace of classical music and the waltz.
- 上句的原句为 The city is the home of ..., (and) this city is the birthplace of ...
- 但两句连在一起无连接词造成结构错误，可以使用 and 连接，但这样显得很冗余，因而需要对并列句做简化：
    - 删除从句中的重复主语：从句中的主语若与主句中的主语相同，则需要删除；不同则保留
    - 动词变为现在分词 Ving
    - 若动词为 be 动词（is、was、are 等），则变为现在分词 being 之后可以省略 being，也可以保留 being 强调“因为”的含义
- I stand on the top of mountain and I can see the whole city. ==> Standing on the top of mountain, I can see the whole city.
